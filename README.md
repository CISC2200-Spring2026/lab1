# CISC2200  Lab1

In this first lab assignment, we setup our **programming environment**, **modify given code**,
and **practice submitting to autograder system**.


## Programming Environment Setup
You can set up programming environment on your own computer by following [Setup Tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/). 

- The _Commannd Line Tools_ are required. 

- The _C++ Dev Environment_ (VSCode) is optional (and recommened if you are already familiar with command line tools). 

If you prefer to follow along videos, here are two YouTube vidoes explaining step-by-step how to setup your computer (laptop or desktop) so that you can develop C/C++ programs using VSCode: 

* Windows: [Setup Windows environment for development ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn4Z3K8kSrM&t=71s)

* MacOS: [Run C/C++ on VSCode for Windows and Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-9sObAg6R0)

Alternatively, you can use the computer servers in CIS department. Please email the instructor if you don't have access to storm or erdos server. 

## Programming Requirement

A code skeleton is given for this lab. From your terminal (mac or WSL/Ubunto) window, you can use the following command to download it:
```
git clone https://github.com/CISC2200-Spring2026/lab1.git
```
You are asked to finish the following (i.e., the three Todo's in the IntArray.cpp), test and run the program:

1. Implement the IntArray class's constructor
2. Implement the desstructor 
3. Implement the reverse member function

## Submission 

Submit your program at the following link by the deadline (TBA) on the following autograder site: (TBA).
