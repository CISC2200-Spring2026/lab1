# CISC2200  Lab1

In this first lab assignment, we setup our **programming environment**, **modify given code**,
and **practice submitting to autograder system**.


## Programming Environment Setup
You can set up programming environment on your own computer by following [Setup Tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/). 
**Note that you are recommended to do so, if you use a Linux environment (MacOS or other Linux) already, or are comfortable with
software installation.**

- The _Commannd Line Tools_ are required. 

- The _C++ Dev Environment_ (VSCode) is optional (and recommened if you are already familiar with command line tools). 

Alternatively, you can use the computer servers in CIS department. Please email the instructor if you don't have access to storm or erdos server. 

## Programming Requirement

A code skeleton is given for this lab. From your terminal (mac or WSL/Ubunto) window, you can use the following command to download it:
```
git clone https://github.com/CISC2200-Spring2026/lab1.git
```
You are asked to finish the following (i.e., the three Todo's in the IntArray.cpp), test and run the program:

1. Implement the IntArray class's constructor
2. Implement the desstructor 
3. Implement the reverse member function

## Submission 

Submit your program at the following link by the deadline (TBA) on the following autograder site: (TBA).
